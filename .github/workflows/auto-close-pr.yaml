  ðŸšš Please, [reopen your PR on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/toby3d/telegraph/merge_requests).

  ## Why?
  Microsoft is acquiring GitHub. I don't want to be a part of this. I have already moved all of my code to GitLab and I will not update any of my github repos anymore.

  If you have opened an issue or PR on one of my repos, it's still there, and it will be for a while, but please keep the conversations going on GitLab instead.

  Microsoft is an enemy of Open Source and Free Software, and I will do my part in moving away from it in any way I can.
